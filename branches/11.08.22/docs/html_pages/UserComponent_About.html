<h1>User component</h1>
This component provides other components with a service of user
authentication. It is used to ensure that other components can decide
the features that should be provided to users of this system.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Tags</h2>
To define user permissions, we use tags that describe the different
permissions that a given user holds. By default, users&nbsp;not logged
inside the system are provided with a tag of "public". For example, if
a given component makes available a service only for users with tag
"private", then we ensure that only users holding this tag on the
properties of their account are allowed to use the service.<br>
<br>
Tags are not hierarchical nor recurrent. If you are assigning a tag to
a folder inside a file server, these permissions do no propagate
automatically to all files and sub folders. <br>
<br>
