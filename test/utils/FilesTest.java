/**
 *  Rules of the testing game:
 *
 *      - If you make changes, add another entry @author below the previous one
 *      - Describe the purpose of the test case and which tests will be done
 *      - Split each group of tests onto its own method and use intuitive names
 *      - Test if something works as intended and also how it reacts to errors
 *      - Add System.out.println comments when:
 *          - A specific test is starting
 *          - A test has finished
 *      - Add an empty line of text between each test to keep results readable
 *      - Be verbose, explain to people what you are doing but keep it simple
 *      - Ensure you test with a clean environment, clean up your mess when done
 *
 *                                          - Thank you.
