= Personal comment =

People have the rigth to know how to make boot disks with their own resources, and they surely deserve good tools and quality scripts to do them the way they really need. Each included project can easily be ported to other programs or tools in order to achieve similar or even better results, there's no intention to produce closed source projects, our goal is quite the opposite - everyone is free to understand how everything works and give a positive contribution to further improve any project available.
 
Let me know if you have a good idea or project you wish to develop using 
Remedium, there is also a forum dedicated to all sort of ideas where
you can post your thoughts. (http://reboot.pro)

As long as you're willing to work hard to get good results, expect nothing less than my dedicated contribution to help things go forward..


Have fun!!
