---- Setting up the SVN ---

SVN is a versioning system that allows a team to share files amongst team members. We use the SVN tool that comes available from NetBeans (our IDE for compiling the program).

Setting up the repository is a relatively simple task and we will use to share documentation and also the source code for this project.
