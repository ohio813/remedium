## Personal comment ##

People have the rigth to improve the security of their machines with affordable tools.

There's no intention to develop a closed source project, our goal is quite the opposite - everyone is free to understand how everything works and give a positive contribution to further improve the available project.

Let me know if you have a good idea or project you wish to develop using
Remedium, don't forget to visit our forum dedicated to all sort of ideas where you can post your thoughts. (http://reboot.pro)

As long as you're willing to work hard to get good results, expect nothing less than my dedicated contribution to help things go forward!


Have fun!!
