- Added LogMessage class, allows classes that require using the log functions from a component to become independent from components. Log messages became objects that can be handled without need for components.
- Added ContainerFlatFile, replaces the HSQL container that is default on remedium to reduce the RAM usage when indexing a large of data
- Created the specification document for the ContainerFlatFile (http://code.google.com/p/remedium/wiki/ContainerFlatFile)

--- TODO ---
- Load data dumped from Instance A onto Instance B


--- MISSING ---
- Dump records: don't overide file if record was written before
- Each component should bear a version number (including the remedium instance)
- Components should be allowed to share public files (and keep track of stats)
- Add max number of attempts when message queue fails to contact external machine
- We need an upgrade or app center urgently
- Components should decide if they are publicly listed or not in manager
- Centrum test case is not really proving that it works as intended
- User messages need to be assigned with a number so that we can translate them
- Would be nice that each component supports translation / submitting values by volunteers
- Current way of sending addresses in Centrum is weak
- Missing to compute the score in a separate thread.
- We need to add numbers onto messages to ease translation effort.
    - The log component can manage translation support
    - Need a solution to work with variables %1, %2,
    - perhaps log(DEBUG,1000,"Found %"+ count + " records"); => test,1000,"Encontrei %1 registos"
    - Log manager records message codes in original language and provides translation when available
    - This method also eases Test cases, allow to look for an exact message code instead of text that can be modified in the future

---- Disadvantages of Remedium
- New development, not mature
- Not completed. Most of the final intended features are not available
- Code development performed by a single person
- Developed in part-time/volunteer basis, slow progress of development
- Java based, requires this platform available on host machines
- Uses a non standard J2EE web development framework
- No XML support in messaging/web service requests
- Non standard User Interface for end-users
- No installation packages available
- No technical support besides volunteer based forum
- Not tested against malicious attacks such as DDoS and authentication bruteforce
- No automatic upgrade to new versions is available
- Supports only English language
- Developer is (obviously) not a web designer


- Interpreted languages
-- Javascript: http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/
