- ContainerFlatFile
    - Corrected delete() method. It was not properly deleting the entries made on MessageQueueFlatFile test case.
    - Container now creates all folders required to start from scratch with nothing other than the executable
- MessageQueueFlatFile
    - Added random number to the ID entry. Using timestamp created conflicts per times
- File component
    - Redesigned file and directory listing. It is now based on database and accouting file downloads
    - Supporting file permission to access/download based on user tags
    - Download filename is now present while downloading files
- Removed the "remlock" parameter from the constructor at the example component (redundant)
- Added the User component, intends to allows users register and maintain an account at our system to services that require access to authenticated credentials
- Each component can now verify if a given web user is logged inside the system or not
- Added Java Docs for the simpleWebServer library
- Added method "findFolders" to the "files" class. Added test case for this method at the FilesTest JUnit class.
- We are now including the icon image inside the jar file, no more need for an external image
- Added a LogComponent, we can now see the log output messages from a web browser as http://localhost:10101/log
- Process Manager
    - The shutdown button is hidden from public access, only available to administrators
- User
    - The component is now creating an admin account by default at startup from scratch
    - Created backend for administration of users
        - Allows editing and deleting users when logged as administrator
    - After registration, user is logged inside system

--- TODO ---
- Container
    ***- Replace the full string read with line by line approach (see if it solves memory issue)

- User
    ***- Prevent multiple login attempts (increase time delay on each wrong attempt)
    ***- Prevent multiple registrations (only one register per IP address)

- File server
    - Add dynamic licenses support
    - Add an extra field for licenses, if present then show them to user
    - Add a back end for administration
        -
    - Clean files that are no longer present on database
    - Add icons to each file displayed
    - Add metrics
        - Files downloaded recently
        - Files downloaded by each user
        - Bandwidth served


- Sentinel
    - Show statistics to guests, only allow authorized users to start processes


- Remove the About Tab - It is not being used as intended
- Integrate SDK with web component
- Serious defect exposed by INIfileTest. Minimal functionality not affected. (Read/Write INI keys)
- LogMesssage getRecent() should output an error message if one occured on a past set of messages
- LogMessage should hold a set of messages instead of a single message. This allows to export several messages while processing a method
- LogMessage should record the time when each log is added to the object, this allows to establish a time line
- LogMessage should write the log to disk using the FlatFile container to save memory resources



--- MISSING ---
- Dump records: don't overide file if record was written before
- Each component should bear a version number (including the remedium instance)
- Components should be allowed to share public files (and keep track of stats)
- Add max number of attempts when message queue fails to contact external machine
- We need an upgrade or app center urgently
- Components should decide if they are publicly listed or not in manager
- Centrum test case is not really proving that it works as intended
- User messages need to be assigned with a number so that we can translate them
- Would be nice that each component supports translation / submitting values by volunteers
- Current way of sending addresses in Centrum is weak
- Missing to compute the score in a separate thread.
- We need to add numbers onto messages to ease translation effort.
    - The log component can manage translation support
    - Log manager records message codes in original language and provides translation when available
    - This method also eases Test cases, allow to look for an exact message code instead of text that can be modified in the future

---- Advantages of Remedium

- Open source, free for home and enterprise users
- Available for Windows, Unix and MacOSX
- Web interface allows local or remote management throught a web browser
- Small sized (less than 10Mb)
- Portable, no need for installing
- Component based architecture
- Message queues permit loosely coupled component interaction
- Controllable from command line
- Embedded database system using HSQL, no need for external SQL servers
- Stores knowledge data up to hundreds of gigabytes on normal workstations
- The web interface is built to support visually impaired users
- Controllable by tablet devices and phones
- Platform available for third-party developers implement their own concepts
- Performance efficient, runs in legacy workstations

---- Disadvantages of Remedium
- New development, not mature
- Not completed. Most of the final intended features are not available
- Code development performed by a single person
- Developed in part-time/volunteer basis, slow progress of development
- Java based, requires this platform available on host machines
- Uses a non standard J2EE web development framework
- No XML support in messaging/web service requests
- Non standard User Interface for end-users
- No installation packages available
- No technical support besides volunteer based forum
- Not tested against malicious attacks such as DDoS and authentication bruteforce
- No automatic upgrade to new versions is available
- Supports only English language
- Developer is (obviously) not a web designer


- Interpreted languages
-- Javascript: http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/
-- PHP: Quercus PHP
-- BeanShell (very similar to Java)
